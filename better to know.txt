here are some results and essentials of my code that are essential to know :

i used both median and mean for filling the null values of my data and evaluated it
on both .

the model worked bad when normalization :


Mean Squared Error for mean(MSE mean): 682910195041932.00
R-squared for mean (R2): 0.65
Mean Squared Error for median(MSE median): 280687208150561.47
R-squared  for med (R2): 0.85

here are the results before normalization :

Mean Squared Error for mean(MSE mean): 615116894344610.62
R-squared for mean (R2): 0.68
Mean Squared Error for median(MSE median): 107671004658676.12
R-squared  for med (R2): 0.94
